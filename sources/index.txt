Cupd, real time dashboard
=========================

Cupd is a real time, nodejs-powered and websocket-based dashboard server. It
exposes an API for services, which publish data, and embeds a small web server
to display a dashboard to the real users. Basically, it allows you to plug any
kind of data source (RSS feeds, IRC chat, web statistics, video streaming and
so on) and broadcast it to an unlimited number of users, through an highly
customizable dashboard interface.
